To share the stories of my Erasmus exchange in Tondheim, Norway, I created the outdoor and travel blog [⟨ ut ⟩](http://ut.gregor-sturm.de). "ut" stands for _out, outside_ in Norwegian.

Like this site, the blog is based on [`Jekyll`](http://jekyllrb.com/). The photos are included with the [`JekyllGalleryTag`](https://github.com/mattvh/JekyllGalleryTag) which automaticall renders preview thumbnails of the images.
