As I wanted to start a blog about my study exchange in Trondheim, Norway, I had finally a reason to deal with my website. Instead of wordpres or other content management systems I decided to use the textprocessor <a href"http://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a> entschieden.<!--more--> I can conveniently write contributions in some text-editor of my choice (vi) and complie it with a simple <code>jekyll build</code> to a static website.

Some technical details about the development process, including some problems and workarounds, are listed below.  

{% for post in site.categories.jekyll %}

<p class="post-excerpt">{{ post.excerpt | strip_html            }}&hellip; (<a href="{{ post.url }}">read more</a>)</p>
{% endfor %}
