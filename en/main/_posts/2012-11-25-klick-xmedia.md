[Crossmedia](http://www.crossmedia-festival.de/index.php) is a multimedia contest for students of bavarian schools that is organised by the [LAG neue medien](http://lag.crossmedia-festival.de/). Every november, all participants are intived to the headquarter of the "Landesbausparkasse" in Munich. There, a great variety of amazing contributions from the field of graphic design, music design, literature, web design, games, 3D-Animations and short movies is
presented.<!--more-->
Apart from that, a just as amazing chilli con carne is served for lunch.

## The project
The website of [KLICK](http://www.klick/immenstadt.de/), a small cultural association in my hometown, has always been a possibility for me to try out new stuff. Already in [2004](http://www.klick-immenstadt.de/_bis2004/), when I did my first steps in HTML, this site was my first "project". Later, when I started to learn (web-)programming in php, I did this by coding my own CMS-system for the associations's homepage. With that version of the homepage I participated in crossmedia 
the first time. Without success -- which is more than understandable, when I look at it today. 

The current version of the site is based on a couple of home-brewed php-classes and relies on a MySQL-database for storage. The objective was to create a very simple CMS, that at the same time, provides tailor-made administration tools for the club. These are amongst others a seat reservation database and a checklist for simplified event planning. 

The design is kept in the association's colors blue and yellow. The slow movement of the picture sidebar tries on the one hand, to draw the attention to the current events, on the other hand not to distract too much from the main page content. The content pages are kept clear-structured and functional.

## Pricing ceremony
With this project, I won the 800â‚¬ endowed first prize in the section "Internet". The [jury praised](http://www.crossmedia-festival.de/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=85&Itemid=86) the niche interplay of shapes, colors and contents. The design puts the content in the centre but remains noticeable in an ingenious way.
