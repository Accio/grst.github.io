There, a great variety of amazingcontributions from the field of graphic design, music design, literature, web design, games, 3D-Animations and short movies is
presented.<!--more-->
Apart from that, a likewise amazing chilli con carne is served for lunch.

## The project
The website of [KLICK](http://www.klick/immenstadt.de/), a small cultural assoziation in my hometown, has always been a possibility for me to try out new stuff. Already in [2004](http://www.klick-immenstadt.de/_bis2004/), when I did my first steps in HTML, this site was my first "project". Also when I started to learn (web-)programming in php, I did this by coding my own CMS-system for the assiziation's homepage. With that version of the homepage I participated in crossmedia for
the first time. Without success - which is highly understandable from my current point of view. 

The current version of the site is based on a couple of home-brewed php-classes and relies on a MySQL-database for storage. The objective was to create a very simple CMS, that at the same time, provides tailor-made administration tools for KLICK. These are amongst others a seat reservation database and a checklist for simplified event planning. 

The design is kept in the assoziation's colors blue and yellow. The slow movement of the picture sidebar tries on the one hand, to guide attention to the current events, on the other hand not to distract too much from the main page content. The content pages are kept simple and functional.

## Pricing ceremony
With this project, I won the first prize in the section "Internet", that is worth 800€. The [jury acknowledges](http://www.crossmedia-festival.de/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=85&Itemid=86) a [translate]. 

eine "gelungene Abstimmung von Formen, Inhalten und Farben". Das Design ordne sich feinfühlig dem Zweck der Seite unter, bleibe aber mit Raffiniess trotzdem spürbar.
