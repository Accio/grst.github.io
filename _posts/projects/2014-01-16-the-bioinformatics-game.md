"Write a game that has something todo with bioinformatics". That was everything they said to us. They -- that's the [rostlab](https://rostlab.org) one of the bioinformatics chairs of TUM. "Us" -- that's me and [Sebastian Wilzbach](http://wilzba.ch), a friend of mine that I met during the bioinforamtics course in Munich and with whom I have been working on quite a few projects before. This should become one more.

## the game
The requirements weren't exactely specific. So what to do? On the one hand, the game should be easy and fun to play - for everyone, not only for bioinformatics students. On the other hand we still wanted to make it enough bioinformatics-ish to be "nerdy" and special. Moreover, it should draw people's interest on bioinformatics and be educative. 

{describe other approaches}
Not having significant experience in neither game nor graphics design we finally had the idea to make soem sort of [Fruit Ninja] clone with proteins.  

I wouldn't exactly say that cocos2dx is a good framework. It is neither performant nor well-documented. On top of that everything has to be writtin in C++, which isn't directly our favorite programming language either. But, after all, it does run on Android and iOS. 

## the development

## further improvements
