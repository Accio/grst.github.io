title: About

I am a PhD student at the [Divison of
Bioinformatics](https://icbi.i-med.ac.at/) of the [Medical University of
Innsbruck](https://www.i-med.ac.at/mypoint/index.xml.en), Austria.

I integrate and analyse single cell RNA-seq data from tumor samples
to better understand how the immune system can be leveraged for
innovative cancer treatments.
